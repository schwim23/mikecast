In AI & Tech, Meta's deal with AMD signals a bold move in the AI chip market, while OpenAI's partnerships underscore its foothold in enterprise solutions. Meanwhile, the business world grapples with tariffs and potential mergers, reflecting broader economic uncertainties. In the corporate sector, scrutiny and internal challenges weigh on tech giants like Meta and Nvidia.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"color:#4fc3f7;border-bottom:1px solid #444;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:28px;\">AI & TECH</h2>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">Meta's substantial chips-for-stock deal with AMD marks a significant stride in the AI chip race, positioning AMD as a more formidable competitor to Nvidia. This partnership aims to bolster both companies' capabilities in artificial intelligence, a field where Nvidia has traditionally dominated. The alliance highlights the increasing importance of AI in driving technological innovation and market competition. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/business/meta-amd-chips-ai.html\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">The New York Times</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">A Pew Research Center study reveals that over half of teenagers now use chatbots for schoolwork, indicating a growing reliance on AI tools in education. This trend raises ethical concerns about academic integrity as chatbot-assisted cheating becomes increasingly common. The findings suggest a need for educational institutions to adapt and address the implications of AI in learning environments. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/technology/schoolwork-chatbot-cheating-pew.html\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">The New York Times</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">Russia's potential ban on the Telegram app, citing terrorism concerns, marks another step in its crackdown on digital freedoms. The investigation into Telegram's founder, Pavel Durov, underscores the tensions between state control and digital privacy. This move could further isolate Russia's internet landscape from global platforms. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/world/europe/russia-telegram-pavel-durov-terrorism.html\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">The New York Times</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">OpenAI's recent deals with consulting giants like Deloitte and PwC reflect its aggressive push into the enterprise sector. These partnerships aim to integrate AI more deeply into business operations, highlighting the growing demand for AI-driven solutions in corporate strategy and operations. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">CNBC</a></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"color:#4fc3f7;border-bottom:1px solid #444;padding-bottom:6px;margin-top:28px;\">BUSINESS & MARKETS</h2>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">The Supreme Court's decision to revive a lawsuit against Whole Foods over tainted baby food underscores the ongoing scrutiny of food safety standards.

This move signals a potential shift in U.S. trade policy, impacting global markets and trade relations. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-trade.html\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">The New York Times</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">Paramount's revised bid for Warner Bros.

These revelations may intensify calls for regulation and corporate accountability. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com\" style=\"color:#81d4fa;text-decoration:none;\">CNN</a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#ccc;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:12px;\">Nvidia's recent earnings report, closely watched by investors, shows the company's continued strength in the AI market.

  "podcast_script": "Hey there, it's February 24th, 2026, and you're tuned into MikeCast, your daily catch-up on all the latest. I'm Mike, your friendly guide through today's top stories. We've got a lot to chat about, from a big chip deal that's shaking up the tech world to some interesting moves in the entertainment industry. Plus, a surprising twist in the weather that left Boston without its beloved Globe for a day. And don't worry, sports fans, I've got some exciting spring training updates for you too. Let's dive in!\n\nKicking things off in AI & Tech, Meta just announced a major chips-for-stock deal with AMD. This is a huge move, folks. AMD has been playing catch-up to Nvidia in the AI chip market, and this deal could give them the boost they need. So why does this matter? AI is powering everything these days, from self-driving cars to personalized recommendations on your favorite streaming service. The companies that dominate this space have a lot of influence over tech's future direction. Keep an eye on how this shakes up the competition.\n\nSpeaking of AI, a new study from the Pew Research Center caught my eye. More than half of teens are using chatbots for schoolwork. Yep, chatbot-assisted cheating is apparently a \"regular feature\" of student life now. I mean, we all know kids are tech-savvy, but this raises some big questions about education and ethics. How do we balance tech's benefits with the need to teach students fundamental skills? It's a conversation worth having.\n\nAnd over in Europe, Russia's moving closer to banning Telegram, claiming it foments terrorism. Pavel Durov, the app's billionaire founder, is under investigation. This is part of a broader crackdown on the free internet in Russia. The stakes here are high. Telegram's been a platform for free speech, especially in places with strict media controls. Banning it could have significant implications for Russian citizens' access to uncensored information.\n\nAlright, switching gears to Business & Markets. The Supreme Court sided with a Texas couple in a case involving tainted baby food from Whole Foods. This decision revives their lawsuit, and it's a big one. It could set a precedent for how food safety cases are handled moving forward, not to mention the potential financial implications for Whole Foods and other retailers.\n\nAnd in a stormy twist, The Boston Globe missed a day of printing due to a blizzard — a first in its long history. It's a reminder of how vulnerable traditional media can be to the forces of nature. It also highlights the ongoing shift to digital news consumption, especially when paper delivery just isn't possible.\n\nNow let's talk companies. Meta's in the news again, and not in a good way. A court filing revealed that a Meta executive warned their Facebook Messenger encryption plan was \"so irresponsible.\" It's a peek behind the curtain at how decisions that affect user security are made. With privacy being such a hot topic, these kinds of revelations can really sway public opinion.\n\nAlso, documents show that Facebook researchers once proposed studying whether their features were addictive. This isn't entirely surprising — we've all felt the pull of endless scrolling. But it's important because it suggests an awareness within the company of the potential downsides of their products, which could influence future regulations.\n\nAnd over at Netflix, the stock took a hit after President Trump set his sights on Director Susan Rice. This isn't just about one person; it's part of a broader narrative where political actions can directly impact corporate fortunes. It's a reminder of how interconnected politics and business have become.\n\nAlright, sports fans, let's get into NY Sports. The Yankees are off to an exciting start with Aaron Judge smashing not one, but two home runs in spring training. Fellow slugger Jones also joined the party with a homer. It's a promising start for the Yanks, and fans are buzzing with excitement for the upcoming season.\n\nMeanwhile, over in basketball, a Knicks G League star is facing some struggles. It's always tough to see promising talent hit a rough patch, but here's hoping he can turn things around and make a big impact.\n\nAlright, let's wrap things up with Big Mike's hand-picked reads. No special picks today, but you know I'll keep you posted with anything must-read that comes my way.\n\nThat's a wrap for today's MikeCast. Thanks for hanging out with me. Don't forget to subscribe so you never miss an episode. And if you liked what you heard, give us a rating or share with a friend. I'm Mike, and I'll catch you on the next one. Stay curious!",
