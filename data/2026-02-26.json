  "podcast_script": "Hey there, it’s February 26, 2026, and you’re listening to MikeCast — your daily serving of news with a side of insight. I'm Mike, catching you up on what’s buzzing today. We’ve got AI raking in billions for Nvidia, privacy concerns with chatbots, and a possible military strike in Iran that’s stirring the geopolitical pot. Plus, how MrBeast’s team is tangled in insider trading. And let’s not forget, Jalen Brunson’s big-time aspirations with the Knicks. Alright, let's dive right in!\n\nKicking things off in the AI & Tech world, Nvidia has hit a massive milestone — $43 billion in quarterly profit thanks to their AI chip sales. Just three years ago, their yearly profit was $4.4 billion. Talk about a glow-up! AI is clearly the golden goose right now, driving Nvidia’s skyrocketing success. So, what does this mean for us? Well, it highlights how AI is becoming an integral part of our lives and economy. It’s reshaping industries and, as we see here, creating major economic shifts.\n\nSpeaking of AI, let’s chat about privacy — or the lack thereof. As AI gets more woven into everyday life, privacy risks are evolving too. People are sharing sensitive data with chatbots without a second thought. But here’s the kicker: if those chats reveal plans for violence, is there a duty to warn the authorities? This question isn’t just academic; it’s the crux of a growing debate about privacy versus safety in the digital age.\n\nAnd if you’re a parent, listen up: AI-generated videos are flooding YouTube, and they’re not as harmless as they appear. Experts warn these videos can be cognitively overwhelming for kids, lacking proper structure and often spreading conflicting information. It’s a digital jungle out there, so keeping an eye on what your kiddos are watching is more important than ever.\n\nAlright, switching gears to Business & Markets. There's a buzz in NYC — our new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, needs a nickname. The city’s tabloids are having a field day with this, from “Z” to “Zo.” But let's talk economic impact: a new mayor means new policies, which could shift the local business landscape. We’ll just have to wait and see how this plays out.\n\nAnd in a bizarre twist, a MrBeast employee is under fire for alleged insider trading. The prediction-market platform, Kalshi, has already reported this to regulators. This one’s a reminder that even in the wild west of online markets, rules still apply. And speaking of rules, there’s a pushback against plans to mint gold coins featuring President Trump for America’s 250th birthday. It’s not just about the bling — it’s a clash over legacy and symbolism.\n\nNow, onto companies! Apple stock is on the rise again — always a crowd favorite in the market. Meanwhile, Meta and AMD are teaming up for a long-term AI infrastructure pact. This is big. It shows how tech giants are pooling resources to stay ahead in the AI race. Partnerships like this could set the stage for the next wave of technological advancements.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about Mary Craven, who passed away at 79. Known for guiding North Syracuse’s ‘Apple Muffin Gang’ back in the day, she left quite an impression. A little nostalgia to remind us of the impact one person can have on their community.\n\nAlright, sports fans, here’s your quick NY sports rundown. The Yankees are gearing up to honor CC Sabathia with a jersey retirement and plaque ceremony in September. A true legend! And in Knicks news, Jalen Brunson’s quest for a championship ring could solidify his status as a team icon. The anticipation is real, folks.\n\nFinally, in Big Mike's hand-picked reads, I'm recommending you check out the piece on the missing Epstein files and the gun battle off the coast of Cuba. It’s a mix of mystery and real-world intrigue that’s worth exploring.\n\nAlright, that’s all for today. Thanks for tuning in to MikeCast! If you liked what you heard, don’t forget to subscribe and share with your friends. Catch you tomorrow for another round of news and insights. Until then, stay curious!",
